= OpenID + JWT
include::_attributes.adoc[]

This tutorial shows how to implement an OpenID Connect flow with a JWT implementation.

We will configure a new Red Hat Build for Keycloak (RHBK) realm and configure it. After that, we will still deploy the stack and configure the user's access to allow roles for different operations. 

[#architecture]
== Architecture
Firstly, we need a RHBK instance. This instance controls the access across our applications. An advantage of OpenID Connect with JWT implementation is the easy way to connect different applications and frameworks, as each has libraries to facilitate that. 

In this case, we'll develop a complete architecture with some microservices. We have one frontend, developed in ReactJS, which shows the data.

The user backend microservice is developed with Quarkus, and we can see an easy integration between Keycloak and the application, thanks to its OpenID library.

[#rhbk]
== RHBK configuration
This section explains how to create a new realm with OpenID connect flow and how to configure it. 



[#backend]
== Backend

[#frontend]
== Frontend

In this section, we want to create a new record in our system, but we have to configure some security points. 

=== Find the frontend URL

[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route -A | grep frontend | awk '{print $3}'
----

When you enter the application you should see a message like this:

image::openid/frontend-02.png[]

This message indicates that you have not logged into the application. So we have to login into the application, to do that we need a user with enough roles to enter into the platform. 

=== Create the user

The first step for us is to create a new user to show all de configuration step by step.

So, enter into the RHBK admin console, go to the "users" section and press the "add user" button.

image::openid/frontend-create-user-01.png[]

In the following screen, we can select some different properties about our new user. We are just going to set the name.

Once the user has been created, we have to set a 
temporal or definitive credential to enter. 

To do it, we go to the "Credentials" tab and press the "Set password" button.

[NOTE,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====
For this example, you can use whatever password you want, but I recommend you to use an easy password as "reader".

=== Login into the frontend application

Now, we have our user with a username and password, so we can return to the frontend URL and try to log in to the application.

If we click the green button, we should be redirected to the Keycloak login page. 

image::openid/frontend-login-01.png[]

Use your credentials, and you'll be redirected to the frontend page again, but now logged in.

Now you should see the following button: 

image::openid/frontend-login-02.png[]

This means you're correctly logged in to the application, but you can't see anything for the ReactJS configuration. 

=== ReactJS configuration

[IMPORTANT,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====
This section shows Javascript code just to show how easy it is to configure a ReactJS application. 

Keycloak gives us a library to integrate into any most popular frontend frameworks to work easily, in this case, I've used ```"keycloak-js": "^22.0.1",```
====

We can see the code and inspect it. The variables ```isAdmin``` and ```isUser``` control the roles of the users. 

The Menu component renders the application menu depending on the roles. So, if the user is an admin, it'll be able to see the "users" option, and if is a player, it can see the matches tab. 

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,javascript, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  const isAdmin = roles.includes('padel-users-admin');
  const isUser = roles.includes('padel-player'); 

  if (isAdmin || isUser) {
    return (
      <Menu borderless>
        {isAdmin && (
          <Menu.Item as={Link} to="/users">
            <Button color="blue" size="small">
              <Icon name="users" /> Usuarios
            </Button>
          </Menu.Item>
        )}
        {isUser && (
          <Menu.Item as={Link} to="/matches">
            <Button color="blue" size="small">
              <Icon name="soccer" /> Partidos
            </Button>
          </Menu.Item>
        )}
      </Menu>
    );
  } else {
    return null; 
  }

As we're working with SPA page, the user may know the path to access, for example, to de admin user's page. This option is controlled by the Keycloak library too:

=== Add roles to the user

# TODO explicar cómo añadir un nuevo role al usuario

# TODO explicar cómo tras añadir el role ya vemos el listado de partidos

=== Add role admin to manage users

    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    return await response.json();
};
