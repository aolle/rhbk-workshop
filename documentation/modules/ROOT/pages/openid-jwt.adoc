= OpenID + JWT
include::_attributes.adoc[]

This tutorial shows how to implement an OpenID Connect flow with a JWT implementation.

We will configure a new Red Hat Build for Keycloak (RHBK) realm and configure it. After that, we will still deploy the stack and configure the user's access to allow roles for different operations. 

[#architecture]
== Architecture
Firstly, we need a RHBK instance. This instance controls the access across our applications. An advantage of OpenID Connect with JWT implementation is the easy way to connect different applications and frameworks, as each has libraries to facilitate that. 

In this case, we'll develop a complete architecture with some microservices. We have one frontend, developed in ReactJS, which shows the data.

The user backend microservice is developed with Quarkus, and we can see an easy integration between Keycloak and the application, thanks to its OpenID library.
