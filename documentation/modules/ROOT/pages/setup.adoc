== 1.3 Deploying an Identity Management (IdM/FreeIPA) on Red Hat OpenShift

This section explains how to install FreeIPA, an Identity Management (IdM) solution that combines Linux, 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP, DNS and Dogtag.

https://www.freeipa.org/page/About

FreeIPA is the upstream version of Red Hat Identity Management.

Later on, we will see how we can integrate Red Hat build of Keycloak with IdM/FreeIPA.

To get started, stay logged in into your Red Hat OpenShift platform, and for convenience, select the `kc` project that has been created previously. Follow the steps below for deploying a FreeIPA instance on top of Red Hat OpenShift.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
# export the image that we are going to deploy
export IMG=quay.io/freeipa/freeipa-openshift-container:4.9.8
export IMG_BASE=${IMG}

# clone the repository and deploy the roles and scc
# if preferred, a remote build could be performed instead of cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-openshift-container.git
cd freeipa-openshift-container/
kustomize build deploy/admin | oc create -f -

# create the ocp template and deploy it
make template-create
make template-new-app
----

Write down the `IPA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `IPA_DM_PASSWORD` displayed on the terminal; we will need it later.

Open the FreeIPA administration console to verify that the access and credentials are working properly.
